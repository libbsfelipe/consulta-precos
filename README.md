This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Before anything, make sure you're connected on Libbs VPN to have access to database.

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Prisma

This project uses Prisma package to communicate with database. See more details about at [https://www.prisma.io/docs/](https://www.prisma.io/docs/).

## NextAuth

This project uses NextAuth to make integrated auth with Azure AD. Se more details at [https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction).

## Rechats

This project uses Recharts to generate data graphs. See more details at [https://recharts.org/en-US/examples](https://recharts.org/en-US/examples).
